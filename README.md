## **Description:**

Google Search, Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search implemented using HTML and CSS.

1. **Google search**.

   Here the user is able to type in a query, click **Google Search** and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
   Clicking the **I'm Feeling Lucky** button takes the user directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.

2. **Google Image Search**

   Here the user is able to type in a query, click **Google Image Search** and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.

3. **Google Advanced Search**

   On the Google Advanced Search page, the user is able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
   - Find pages with… “all these words:”
   - Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
   - Find pages with… “any of these words:”
   - Find pages with… “none of these words:”

On the Google Search page, there are links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there is a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.
